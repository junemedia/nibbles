<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'><font face="Arial" size="2">Joe
Skalski is a firefighter </font></span><FONT face=Arial size="2">for two communities 
- the town of Arlington Heights, Illinois&nbsp;and the village of Cary, Illinois. 
 </FONT><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'><font face="Arial" size="2">Though he was half a country away from the
attacks, he, like all police and firefighters, felt its effects very
closely.</font><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp; </font></span><font face="Arial" size="2">When he saw the famous photo
of three firefighters covered in ash raising the U.S. flag over the rubble, he
surely felt the same pangs of pride and solidarity through tragedy that many of
us felt.</font><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp; </font></span><font face="Arial" size="2">Following the tragedy, he
traveled with others from his department to serve in the honor guard at
funerals and wakes for his New York brothers.</font><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Arial" size="2">That experience and the photo's lasting image sparked a very unique idea
in his mind.</font></span></p>
<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'><font face="Arial" size="2">Joe
loves to cross stitch, a hobby that has been the root of much ribbing and
joking in the firehouse from his fellow firefighters.</font><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp; </font></span><font face="Arial" size="2">It is a hobby he learned while he was confined to bed rest for
four months following a car accident.</font><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Arial" size="2">The others in the firestation call him &quot;Grandma&quot; when he's
stitching at the house.</font><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp; </font></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'><font face="Arial" size="2">But
when he started on the project of stitching the famous photo by Thomas E.
Franklin, the others held their tongues.</font><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Arial" size="2">He worked with Thomas and his lawyers to obtain permission to use the
protected photo that had won the Pulitzer Prize.</font><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp; </font></span><font face="Arial" size="2">He then transferred the photo to a counted cross stitch grid and
began the work of stitching the 66,000 stitches.</font></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'><font face="Arial" size="2">At 14
squares per inch and with most squares being a different color to capture the
depth of the photo, from a distance it's impossible to tell the difference
between his finished piece and the photo.</font><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Arial" size="2">It's not until you are within a foot or two that you can tell it is made
up of tiny stitched squares.</font><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp; </font></span><font face="Arial" size="2">The
project took Joe a full year to complete, but it's his way of remembering those
brothers lost on September 11.</font></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'><font face="Arial" size="2">Joe is
looking to sell his finished work to raise money for the widows and orphans of
the fallen New York firefighters.</font><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp; </font></span><font face="Arial" size="2">He's
hoping to raise as much as $10,000 for the fund.</font><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp; </font></span><font face="Arial" size="2">Joe has used his talent to remember his heroes while becoming a
hero himself for his patience, time, effort, and generosity.</font></span></p>
