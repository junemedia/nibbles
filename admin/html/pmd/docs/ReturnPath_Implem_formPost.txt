Return Path Implementation for form post


First, add to current form the bold line below:

…<FORM id="" name="" action=http://signup.postmasterdirect.com/signup.mhtml method=post>
< input type=hidden value=YOUR_SITE name=owner> 
< input type=hidden name=gatherer value=YOUR_GATHERER> 
<input name=thankyouurl value="http://" type=hidden>
<input name=disableconfirmationwarning value="" type=hidden>
<input type="hidden" name="coreg" value="returnpath">…

This is a generic line and is the same for all owners.

Second, usually under your email input field you can put this line:

<input name="old_email" type="text" id="old_email" size="10" maxlength="50">

Placement of this input field should be close to the regular email field. 

Third, you should include a message to state that the old email field is optional. 
Ex. “Enter your old email address to enter ReturnPath's service that helps you stay in touch”


You can also to choose to include the Return Path logo which can be found at:

Example code to include image:
<img src="http://gfx.postmasterdirect.com/hosted_images/rp/rp.gif" alt="Enter your old email to make sure people can find you at your new one." width="92" height="31" border="0">
