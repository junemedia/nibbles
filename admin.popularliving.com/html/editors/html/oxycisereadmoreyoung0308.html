align=left vspace=5 border=0></A>Jill Johnson was chubby as a child, hefty-sized 
as a teen, very plump in her school teacher days and extra fat as a new mom.</P>
<P>Being overweight seemed a lifelong curse and when it came to fat jokes, Jill 
heard them all. &quot;Gelatin butt&quot; and &quot;walking garbage can&quot; are two that come to 
mind.</P>
<P>That all changed 15 years ago as Jill approached 30 weighing in at a 
gut-busting 200 pounds-and a doctor told her she had the back of a 
50-year-old.</P>
<P>Unless she lost weight Jill would need surgery and the thought scared her 
into action.</P>
<P>The former teacher, who'd never found a weight loss program to suit her, 
created a successful one for herself-a remarkably simple 15-minute-a-day series 
of deep-breathing exercises that are done while stretching and holding the body 
in certain positions.</P>
<P>She calls it the &quot;Oxycise!&quot; system-and it's being hailed by experts and in 
newspaper articles as a breath of fresh air in a world of body-jolting exercise 
routines and diet fads.</P>
<P>&quot;To my amazement, I lost 45 pounds in six months without giving up the foods 
I loved but by merely increasing my oxygen intake through deep-breathing 
exercises,&quot; said Jill.</P>
<P>By age 31, the Colorado native was a slenderific 125-pound, size 6. Today at 
44, she's the same size, thanks to her &quot;Oxycise!&quot; routine, which you can learn 
on your own in this specially priced two-videocassette offer.</P>

width=106 align=right border=0></A>On one video, Jill teaches you the deep 
breathing routines and the simple stretching and body-squeezing exercises done 
in combination with them.</P>
<P>The other videocassette takes you through the same 15-minute daily workout 
routine that transformed Jill from size 16 to size 6.</P>
<P>Lynnda Coyle knows what that means. She lost 36 pounds in two months using 
Jill's 15 minute-a-day program and &quot;noticed my energy level going up, my lower 
back strengthening and my outlook on life improved. I will never go back to 
regular exercise again.&quot; </P>
<P>In 1998, Jill turned to cable TV and the QVC shopping channel to market her 
&quot;Oxycise!&quot; videos; a 145-page book about the system with photographic 
illustrations and an audiocassette that lets you &quot;Oxycise!&quot; while you're in your 
car.</P>
<P>The response was overwhelming. More than 500,000 orders for Jill's system 
have poured in as overweight people learned they can lose pounds and increase 
their energy without dieting and without breaking a sweat.</P>
<P>With the &quot;Oxycise!&quot; program, you don't have to follow a sugar-free, low-fat 
or low-carbohydrate diet, take pills or drink shakes for meals.</P>
<P>And you don't have to buy expensive exercise equipment, join a trendy gym, 
jump up and down to disco music or do crunching calisthenics.</P>
<P>All you have to do is stand, sit or lie down in the comfort of your home, 
while doing the gentle deep-breathing and toning exercises. And all you need is 
the air that you breathe, which is free.<BR>Jill's success story has been the 
subject of numerous newspaper and magazine stories and she's appeared on 
numerous TV and radio shows.</P>

<P>The Denver Business Journal noted that most letter writers who applaud 
&quot;Oxycise!&quot; first mention the beneficial effects on their health.</P>
<P>Those are the people who make Jill smile the most.</P>
<P>&quot;The real enjoyment comes in seeing people so desperate and frustrated find 
success,&quot; she said.<BR>Women's World magazine noted how &quot;Oxycise&quot; follows a 
simple fact of life that allows anyone to lose weight.</P>
<P>Simply put: High doses of oxygen kick-start your body cells into burning more 
of the food you eat-and even stored fat-for energy.</P>
<P>In the research Jill did while creating her &quot;Oxycise!&quot; system and in 
interviews with health care experts, she learned that simple rule.</P>
<P>And she also learned that most people, especially overweight people, don't 
breathe in enough air.</P>
<P>&quot;Although our lungs can hold two gallons of oxygen, studies show that most of 
us breathe in only two pints,&quot; said Jill.</P>
<P>Once she knew that, Jill concentrated on creating a deep-breathing exercise 
program that lets your lungs fill with fat-burning oxygen.</P>
<P>The result was a program praised by participants and healthcare professionals 
alike. Dr. Robert W. Rigg, Jr., M.D. from Canoga Park, CA, says &quot;I recommend it 
for anyone who desires to lose extra weight in an effective and safe 
manner.&quot;</P>
<P>What's more, an exercise-science study at a leading university has also given 
the &quot;Oxycise!&quot; system a scientific thumbs-up. Testers found that Jill's painless 
15-minute program burned up 140 percent more calories than the same time spent 
grunting away on a stationary bicycle.</P>
<P>Testimonials from happy and thinner &quot;Oxycise!&quot; customers are proof of 
that.</P>
<P>&quot;'Oxycise!' is the best workout I've ever done,&quot; wrote Susan Madal. &quot;I've 
lost about 15 pounds and gone from a size 11 to size 6 in three months.&quot;</P>
<P>Incredibly, Debbie Stancil lost 142 pounds the &quot;Oxycise!&quot; way and feels &quot;like 
I have been let out of prison.&quot;</P>
<P>Those are the kind of words Jill loves to hear.</P>
<P>So, what are you waiting for? With &quot;Oxycise!&quot; you have nothing to lose but 
unwanted pounds.<BR></P></TD></TR>
