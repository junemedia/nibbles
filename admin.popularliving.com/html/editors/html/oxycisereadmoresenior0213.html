Johnson knows what it's like to be fat. She was chubby as a child, hefty-sized 
as a teen, very plump in her school teacher days and jumbo as a new mom. </P>
<P>The former 200-pounder had been searching for years for a weight-loss program 
that would work, until a health crisis forced her to create her own. Jill was 
facing back surgery due to her weight, and - after months of research - she 
developed a remarkably simple 15-minute-a-day fitness system of deep-breathing 
exercises. </P>
<P>&quot;To my amazement, I lost 45 pounds in six months without giving up the foods 
I loved but by merely increasing my oxygen intake,&quot; said Jill, 45, who maintains 
a slenderific 125-pound figure. </P>
<P>Jill's program follows a simple fact of life that allows anyone to lose 
weight. Simply put: Breathing in high doses of oxygen kick-starts your body 
cells into burning more of the food you eat - and even stored fat - for energy. 
But most people, especially heavy people, don't breathe in enough air. </P>

our lungs can hold two gallons of oxygen, most of us breathe in only two pints,&quot; 
said Jill, whose system lets your lungs fill with fat-burning oxygen. </P>
<P>Her system - named &quot;Oxycise!&quot; - was hailed by experts as a breath of fresh 
air in a world of body-jolting exercise routines and diet fads. </P>

<P>In 1998, Jill turned to a cable TV shopping channel to market her &quot;Oxycise!&quot; 
system in the form of two videotapes, an illustrated book and an audiotape. The 
response was overwhelming. More than 500,000 orders poured in as overweight or 
out of shape people learned that they could lose pounds, increase their energy 
and STILL eat the foods they like. </P>
<P>Now Jill has created a new two-videocassette package, &quot;Oxycise! Easy Does 
It,&quot; especially for seniors and for all those who have a hard time bending. With 
&quot;Oxycise! Easy Does It,&quot; no one is ever too old to shape up. </P>
<P>Take Bill S., who's 81. Bill crows that the rewards of the &quot;Oxycise!&quot; system 
&quot;have been terrific.&quot; Not only has his energy increased, he boasts that his body 
looks so good, &quot;I would not be reluctant to pose nude alongside many of the 
average 35- to 50-year-old men.&quot; </P>
<P>That would come as no surprise to the residents of Colonnades at On Top of 
the World, a Florida retirement community. Not only did inches melt away from 
their tummies and hips - thanks to &quot;Oxycise!&quot; many of them report they are 
sleeping better or are experiencing improved blood pressure and cholesterol 
levels. A diabetic now takes less insulin. A woman plagued by foot cramps is 
cramp-free. People who were experiencing breathing problems find they are 
breathing better. </P>
<P>&quot;I was amazed,&quot; said Teri Havener, Colonnades at On Top of the World's 
fitness director, who started the seniors on the &quot;Oxycise!&quot; system at their 
request and monitored their progress. Teri admits that at first she was 
skeptical that a system so simple could work. But when the seniors in her class 
reported increased energy, felt healthier and sported measurably slimmer 
figures, she not only became a believer - she now uses &quot;Oxycise!&quot; herself. With 
&quot;Oxycise! Easy Does It&quot; you don't have to follow a sugar-free, low-fat or 
low-carbohydrate diet, take pills or drink shakes. And you don't have to jump up 
and down to disco music. All you have to do is gentle deep-breathing and toning 
exercises in the comfort of your own home. And you don't need fancy or expensive 
exercise equipment - all you need is a chair and the air you breathe, which is 
free. </P>

<P>In the first &quot;Oxycise! Easy Does It&quot; video, Jill teaches the deep breathing 
routines and the simple stretching and body-squeezing exercises done in 
combination with them. The second video takes you through the 15-minute daily 
workout that helped Colonnades at On Top of the World seniors increase their 
energy, lose inches and feel healthier. </P>
<P>At 74, Lila Babbidge lost inches off her stomach and thighs in just a few 
weeks. &quot;I look wonderful,&quot; gushes Lila. Her husband was so proud, he took 
pictures of Lila in a two-piece bathing suit and hung them on the wall. </P>
<P>Jill's program is praised by participants and healthcare professionals alike. 
Says Dr. Robert W. Rigg, Jr., M.D. from Canoga Park, CA, &quot;I have seen the 
positive and permanent results from &quot;Oxycise!&quot; and definitely recommend it for 
anyone who desires to lose extra weight in an effective and safe manner.&quot; </P>
<P>What's more, a recent exercise-science study at a nationally known university 
has given the &quot;Oxycise!&quot; system a scientific thumbs-up. Testers found that 
Jill's painless 15-minute program burned up 140 percent more calories than the 
same time spent grunting away on a stationary bicycle. </P>
<P>Incredibly, Debbie Stancil, 48, who was so heavy she was virtually trapped in 
her recliner, lost a mind-boggling 157 pounds the &quot;Oxycise!&quot; way. &quot;I feel like a 
new person and like I have been let out of prison,&quot; writes Debbie. </P>
<P>So, what are you waiting for? With the &quot;Oxycise!&quot; system you have everything 
to gain but unwanted weight. </P></TD></TR>
