        <ol>
            <li>Any and all e-mail-based Advertisements transmitted to the Publisher Databases: (i) shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws including, but not limited to, the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended ("CAN-SPAM") and any and all Federal Trade Commission implementing regulations; (ii) must not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate any copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other similar intellectual property right, or otherwise violate or breach any duty toward, or rights of, any person or entity including, without limitation, rights of privacy and publicity; and (c) must not result in any consumer fraud, product liability or breach of contract to which Publisher is a party or cause injury to any third-party.</li>
            
           <li>Publisher is responsible for knowing the source of the e-mail addresses contained in the Publisher Databases. E-mail addresses used in connection with the Publisher Databases hereunder may not be obtained by the use of a program for random generation of e-mail addresses and/or "scraping" Web sites or other online services. Publisher must have full Consent Verification (as that term is defined hereinbelow) data for all e-mail addresses contained in the Publisher Databases.</li>
            
            <li>Publisher shall cause a valid physical postal address for Publisher and/or the applicable Advertiser, as required by applicable law, to appear in each e-mail Advertisement, along with a functioning unsubscribe link (such unsubscribe link must remain active for at least thirty (30) days after e-mail delivery).

Publisher may not sell or transfer an e-mail address once the e-mail address owner has opted-out of receiving future communications from Publisher.</li>
            
            <li>Publisher may not use an Advertiser's name (including any abbreviation thereof) in the originating e-mail address line or subject line of any e-mail transmission.</li>
            
            <li>No e-mails transmitted by Publisher hereunder may include falsified header information, false registrations for e-mail accounts or false IP addresses used in connection with such e-mail transmissions or re-transmissions of e-mails for the purpose of concealing such e-mail's origin. Publisher is further prohibited from relaying or retransmitting e-mails from a computer or computer network that was accessed without authorization.</li>
            
           <li>Subject lines may not contain any false or misleading information such that it would likely mislead a reasonable recipient as to the content or subject matter of the underlying e-mail message. Publisher may only use approved Subject Lines made available for use in connection with the applicable Campaign or other Subject Lines for which it has received written approval from Company.</li>
            
            <li>Each e-mail must identity itself as an advertisement or solicitation by "clear and conspicuous" means.</li>
            
            <li>In the event that Company or an Advertiser receives a complaint from any recipient of an e-mail Advertisement transmitted by Publisher, upon Company and/or Advertiser's request, as applicable, Publisher will immediately provide the requesting party with appropriate records verifying such recipient's consent to receive e-mail transmissions from the applicable Publisher Database. Such records shall include, but may not necessarily be limited to, the URL of the underlying Web site where the recipient consented to receive e-mail transmissions from the applicable Publisher Database, the date and time stamp of such recipient's consent, the IP address of the computer used by the recipient at the time consent was provided and the privacy policy of such underlying Web Site (collectively, "Consent Verification").</li>

Publisher shall upload its own list of suppressed e-mail addresses to the FTP Site, if one is provided by Company. If the FTP Site is provided by Company, and no such suppressed e-mail addresses are supplied by Publisher, then Company may conclude that no such addresses exist. The suppression list and login provided by Company are deemed to be Confidential Information of Company, as defined herein. Suppression lists may not be used by Publisher for any purpose other than to comply with applicable laws regulating e-mail transmissions. Publisher agrees to process any unsubscribe requests within five (5) days of being posted at the FTP site.</li>
    	</ol>
	</li>
        
    <li><p><span class="underlinetxt">Use of Advertisements.</span> Publisher shall not alter, modify or otherwise change the Advertisements, or any other Advertisement-related feature, that it obtains access to in connection with any Campaign in any manner whatsoever without Company's prior express written consent. Unless otherwise stated in writing by Company, each of the Advertisements made available to Publisher in relation to any Campaign must include, in unaltered form, the Company special transaction tracking codes as embedded in all Advertisements (the "Transaction Tracking Codes"). Publisher will not knowingly, modify, circumvent, impair, disable or otherwise interfere with any Transaction Tracking Codes and/or other technology and/or methodology required or made available by Company to be used in connection with any and all Advertisements. No images, graphics, links, co-registration paths, pop-ups, pop-unders, copy or process for generating actions other than the Advertisements may be used by Publisher without first obtaining the prior express written consent of both Company and the applicable Advertiser. Publisher must place or use the Advertisements only with the intention of delivering valid Compensable Transactions as determined by, and for the benefit of, the applicable Advertiser. Publisher may not, nor knowingly permit any person to, activate an Advertisement or inflate the amount of Compensable Transactions through any deceptive or misleading practice, method or technology including, but not limited to, the use of any spyware, adware, device, program, robot, Iframes, hidden frames, redirects, automatic page-spawning, spiders, computer script or other automated, artificial or fraudulent methods designed to appear like an individual, real live person performing a Compensable Transaction. Publisher may not establish or cause to be established any promotion that provides any incentive including, but not limited to, sweepstakes entries, rewards, points or other compensation to be earned in connection with generating Compensable Transactions, or otherwise attempt to induce Users to click on any of the Advertisements through use of any other incentives, without obtaining the prior written approval of Company and the applicable Advertiser. In connection with Publisher's SEM or otherwise, Publisher may not, nor knowingly permit any person to, use third-party trademarks without the express permission of the trademark holder in any fashion that would direct traffic to any Publisher Web site, Advertiser Web site or other online destination including, but not limited to, purchasing keywords from a search engine service provider that include the trademark, service mark and/or brand name, or any derivative of any such trademark, service mark or brand name, of any of the Advertisers, Company and/or any of their respective affiliates or clients. Publisher may not allow the Advertisements to be placed on any non-Publisher Web site or in e-mails to any non-Publisher Databases without the prior express written consent of both Company and the applicable Advertiser.</p>
    
    Company and/or the applicable Advertiser may alter, modify and/or terminate, at any time, any Advertisements associated with any Campaign. Publisher must promptly remove such Advertisements after any such termination and/or after any termination or expiration of the applicable Campaign. All determinations made by Company in connection with the Advertisements, Compensable Transactions and any associated Commissions due to Publisher shall be final and binding on Publisher. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company's services do not involve investigating or resolving any claim or dispute involving Publisher and any Advertiser or other third-party. Publisher may not use any Advertisements or any other Company Network Campaign information, terms and/or content in connection with aggregating, soliciting or recruiting Advertisers, other Publishers, other Web sites or other persons to form or join an affiliate marketing, advertising or similar network for the purpose of engaging in business of the type conducted by Company. Company reserves the right to audit any Web site traffic at any time and for any reason, or no reason at all. Should Company determine, in the exercise of its reasonable business judgment, that Publisher has undertaken any fraudulent methods to inflate Compensable Transactions described in this Section 4 or otherwise: (i) Publisher's membership in the Company Network will be immediately terminated; (ii) any unpaid Commissions attributable to the subject Campaign will be immediately voided, whether or not earned; and (iii) upon demand, Publisher will return to Company immediately any Commissions attributable to the subject Campaign that had been previously paid.</li>
    
    <li><span class="underlinetxt">Placement of Advertisements.</span> Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Campaign Terms or by Company at any time, and subject to the restrictions contained herein, the positioning, placement, frequency and other editorial decisions related to Advertisements shall be made by Publisher. Publisher must comply, immediately, with any and all requests by Company and/or the applicable Advertiser to modify, alter or otherwise change the positioning, placement, frequency and other editorial decisions as they relate to Advertisements.</li>
    
    <li><p><span class="underlinetxt">Guidelines.</span> In addition to the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Application and the Campaign Terms, if any, the following guidelines shall apply at all times:</p>
    	<ol>
            <li>All URLs submitted for inclusion as Publisher Web sites are subject to review and may be rejected for any reason by Company. The following are examples of the types of Web sites that will not be accepted: adult Web sites containing pornographic or offensive material; Web sites engaged in the piracy or unauthorized use of copyrighted, trademarked, or patented material; software trading (warez) Web sites; hacking/phreaking Web sites; libelous or defamatory Web sites; Web sites containing software piracy; and/or Web sites with any illegal activity whatsoever. The examples are meant to be illustrative only and under no circumstances shall be construed as an exhaustive list.</li>
            
           <li>Only Unique Sign-Ups shall qualify as Compensable Transactions. Non-Unique Sign-Up data will not be paid on. Upon payment for the Unique Sign-Up, Company shall have no further obligation to Publisher. Company and/or its Advertisers, in their sole discretion, shall have the right to market and re-market the person(s) and or data represented in the Unique Sign-Up, without further obligation to Publisher.</li>
            
            <li>If required by the Advertiser, Unique Sign-Ups and/or leads must be valid Double Opt-Ins in order to be considered valid Compensable Transactions. Where specified by the applicable Advertiser in the Campaign Terms, any Unique Sign-Ups and/or leads that are not valid Double Opt-Ins and/or that do not complete all the required information will not be considered Compensable Transactions. Publisher and Company acknowledge that any of the data contained in any leads rejected as invalid Unique Sign-Ups and/or leads may, on occasion, be retained and marketed by the Advertiser and/or Company, to the extent possible. Please be advised that the Commission rate for Unique Sign-Ups and/or leads offered to and accepted by Publisher has factored in compensation for such invalid data, and the price for valid Unique Sign-Ups and/or leads without this consideration would otherwise be lower.</li>
          </ol>
    
    2.2. 6.4 Publisher must not: (i) place statements near the Advertisements requesting that Users "click" on the Advertisement (i.e., "Please "click here") or "visit" the sponsor (i.e., "Please visit our sponsor."); or (ii) place misleading statements near the Advertisement (i.e., "You will win $5,000.").
    </li>
    
    <li><span class="underlinetxt">Reports.</span> Company will provide Publisher with accurate, verifiable reporting on the Compensable Transactions for each Campaign, which shall include, without limitation, the number and amount of Compensable Transactions, and the date, time and URL(s) associated with such Compensable Transactions ("Publisher Reports"). The data in such Publisher Reports shall be used, in part, by Company to calculate the payments due to Publisher. Where Publisher believes that any of the Publisher Reports, or the calculation of the associated Compensable Transactions for such month, contain errors, Publisher must notify Company, in writing, within ten (10) business days of Publisher's receipt of such Publisher Report. Company will review the records in dispute and will decide whether to issue a credit to Publisher equal to any invalid reporting, in its sole discretion. Any Commissions-related dispute between Publisher and any Advertiser must be resolved by Publisher and that Advertiser. In the event that Company is in receipt of funds from an Advertiser for the purpose of paying Commissions to Publisher, and a dispute arises between Publisher and the applicable Advertiser regarding the amount of the funds that are due to Publisher, Company shall be entitled to return such funds to the Advertiser, and to decline to offer further processing services until such dispute is resolved and Company is notified, in writing, by both parties that payments should resume. Publisher agrees that Company shall have no obligations and incur no liabilities to Publisher in connection with any such dispute. Unless disputed within the applicable period, the Publisher Reports will be deemed accepted by Publisher. If, due to any impairment of the Transaction Tracking Codes or any other reason, Company is unable or fails to provide Publisher with accurate and/or complete Publisher Reports, Company shall calculate Compensable Transactions ("Projected Compensable Transactions") based upon: (i) the average monthly Compensable Transactions of Publisher as recorded by Company for the applicable Campaign, prorated for any shorter or longer period of time, where data is available to calculate a monthly average; or (ii) such amount that Company reasonably determines is due and owing, in its sole discretion, where data needed to calculate Publisher's average monthly Compensable Transactions is unavailable.</li>
    
    <li><p><span class="underlinetxt">Compensation.</span> Company will pay Publisher commissions for each Compensable Transaction ("Commissions") in the amounts, and at the times, as set forth in the applicable Campaign Terms associated with each Advertisement. Unless otherwise stated in the Campaign Terms, and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 8.3 hereinbelow, Commissions shall be paid to Publisher out of the funds collected from the applicable Advertiser approximately forty-five (45) days after the last day of a given calendar month, for Commissions realized in that month.</p>
    	<ol>
            <li><span class="underlinetxt">When Commissions are Earned.</span> Commissions will be payable only when "earned." Commissions will not be considered "earned" until Company receives the corresponding payment from the applicable Advertiser. Company reserves the right to reduce any and all Commissions owed to Publisher where Company has been unable to collect the associated payments from the applicable Advertiser(s). Company shall not be responsible to Publisher where Advertiser(s) has/have not remitted sufficient payments to cover the Commissions otherwise due and owing Publisher. Instead, Publisher shall have the right to pursue any and all legal remedies directly against any Advertiser that has not made funds available to pay sums due and owing to Publisher for Commissions earned in connection with a particular Campaign. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company may elect to advance to you Commissions prior to those Commissions having been earned. Publisher acknowledges and agrees that its receipt of Commission payments prior to those Commissions having been earned is conditional and subject to Company's right to demand return of unearned Commissions for any reason or for no reason at all.</li>
            
            <li><span class="underlinetxt">Minimum Commission Requirement for Regular Payment.</span> Company shall not be obligated to make any payment of Commissions to Publisher unless the aggregate amount of earned Commissions equals or exceeds Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00). Any earned but unpaid Commissions shall carry over to the next regularly scheduled payment period. Upon termination of this Agreement, or Publisher's participation in the subject Campaign, Company shall remit to Publisher any earned but unpaid Commissions.</li>
            
            <li><span class="underlinetxt">Chargebacks/Returns.</span> Advertiser may request that Company, or Company may on its own initiative, debit from the Commissions otherwise due and owing Publisher an amount equal to a Commission previously credited to Publisher's account where: (i) a return or cancellation has been made with respect to the applicable product and/or service that comprised the subject Compensable Transaction; (ii) there is an instance of a duplicate, fraudulent or incomplete entry or other similar error with respect to a customer order where such order was the subject Compensable Transaction; (iii) there are Compensable Transactions that do not comply fully with the terms of this Agreement and/or Campaign Terms, including where the applicable non-complying Compensable Transaction is not the result of Publisher's action, omission and/or failure to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and/or Campaign Terms; (iv) there is non-receipt of payment from, or refund of payment to, the User that entered into the subject Compensable Transaction; or (v) there is any failure on the part of Publisher to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and/or the applicable Campaign Terms (collectively referred to as a "Chargeback"). Chargebacks requested by an Advertiser in accordance with this Section 8.3 may be applied up to sixty (60) days after the end of the month in which the applicable Commission was earned ("Chargeback Period"). An Advertiser may request that the payment of a Commission be postponed for one (1) payment cycle where: (i) Advertiser is verifying a Unique Sign-Up and/or lead (for Campaigns in which Unique Sign-Up and/or lead generation is a component of the Compensable Transaction); (ii) Advertiser has a product return policy that allows the underlying purchaser to return the product during the Chargeback Period; or (iii) the terms and conditions of a given Campaign provide for such a postponement.</li>
            
            <li>Publisher is solely responsible for any and all tax obligations, if any, due to taxing authorities arising from or in connection with Publisher's participation in the Company Network and/or any Campaign.</li>
            
            <li>Publisher may have a negative balance where Publisher's account is debited amounts equivalent to previous Commission payments for Chargebacks and Publisher does not have an adequate account balance to cover the Chargeback amounts. Whenever Publisher has a negative balance, Publisher must immediately remit a payment to Company in an amount sufficient to bring Publisher's account to at least a zero balance. Publisher may make payments hereunder via check, wire transfer or certain credit cards. When payment is made by check, Publisher's account will not reflect payment until the check has cleared and cash has been transferred to Company's bank account. Publisher's positive account balance will not accrue interest. If Publisher has a negative balance for any period of forty-five (45) days or more, Publisher's account will be subject to interest in the amount of one and one half percent (1.5%) per month, compounded monthly. Publisher's account may be deactivated for non-payment.</li>
            
            <li>The number or amount of Compensable Transactions, credits for payments and debits for Chargebacks, as calculated by Company, shall be final and binding on Publisher. In the event that Publisher owes Company monies pursuant to any Campaign where Publisher participates in the Company Network as an Advertiser, or any other agreement between the parties, Company may offset any amounts due to Publisher under such Campaign or any other agreement against any amounts outstanding under this Agreement or such other agreements, and provide Publisher with notification after completion of such offset. Company will not pay any Commissions to Publisher unless Company has documentation to support such Commissions within its database. Company may require Publisher to provide a W-9, or similar information, as a condition to receiving any Commission payments. Company reserves the right to withhold and/or cancel Commission payments otherwise due and owing to Publisher at any time when Company believes, in Company's sole discretion, that Publisher is in breach of this Agreement and/or the applicable Campaign Terms.</li>
