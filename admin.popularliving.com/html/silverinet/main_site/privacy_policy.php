                    purposes. If you are a resident of the State of California and would like to 
                    opt-out from the disclosure of your personal information to any third party for 
                    marketing purposes, please <a href="http://www2.myinsiderdeals.com/Unsubscribe.aspx?referrer=1039-24606E">click

                    <p>When visitors elect to become members of <a href="http://www.SilveriNet.com/">SilveriNet.com</a>, we request that 
                    they provide additional, personally-identifiable information.  This includes name, address, e-mail 
                    address, telephone number, age bracket, day and month of birth.  All registrants may receive e-
                    mail confirming their registration, and subsequent correspondence.  If you do not want to receive 
                    e-mail from us in the future, please let us know by using the unsubscribe option on the bottom of 
                    every email.  Certain information, such as your e-mail address, is collected in order to, among 
                    other functions, verify your identity in the future within our database.  When you select to 
                    receive information about offerings from a third party company during the registration process, 
                    we will share your personal information with that third party company to carry out your 
                    information request.  <a href="http://www.SilveriNet.com/">SilveriNet.com</a> may also use such information to directly 
                    market certain offers to you (via e-mail, direct mail and/or telemarketing), to monitor compliance 
                    with our Terms and Conditions and for content improvement and feedback purposes.  We may 
                    sell the personal information that you supply to us and we may join together with other 
                    businesses to bring selected retail opportunities to our members.  These businesses may include, 
                    but are not limited to:  (a) providers of direct marketing services and applications, including 
                    lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation; (b) e-mail marketers; and 
                    (c) telemarketers. </p>
                    
                    <p>We may also employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf. 
                    Examples include sending direct and electronic mail, removing duplicate information from 
                    customer lists, analyzing data, and providing marketing analysis.  These agents have access to 
                    our members' personal information as needed to perform their functions for 
                    <a href="http://www.SilveriNet.com/">SilveriNet.com</a>, but we do not permit them to use our members' personal 
                    information for other purposes.</p>
                    
                    <p><a href="http://www.SilveriNet.com/">SilveriNet.com</a> reserves the right to release current or past member information 
                    in the event <a href="http://www.SilveriNet.com/">SilveriNet.com</a> believes that the membership is being or has been 
                    used in violation of the Website's terms and conditions, or to commit unlawful acts, if the 
                    information is subpoenaed, if <a href="http://www.SilveriNet.com/">SilveriNet.com</a> is sold or acquired, or when 
                    <a href="http://www.SilveriNet.com/">SilveriNet.com</a> deems it necessary or appropriate.  By agreeing to these 
                    conditions, you hereby consent to disclosure of any record or communication to any third party, 
                    when .com, in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate 
                    including, without limitation, sharing your e-mail address with other third-parties for suppression 
                    purposes in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time to time, and 
                    Federal Trade Commission enabling regulations.</p>
                    
                    <p>In addition, by registering at the Website, you agree that such act constitutes an inquiry and/or 
                    application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 CFR ¤310 et seq.), as 
                    amended from time to time (the "Rule").  Notwithstanding that your telephone number may be 
                    listed at the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call List, we retain the right to contact you via 
                    telemarketing in accordance with the Rule.</p>
                    
                    <p>From time to time, we may receive personal information about you from outside sources and add 
                    it to your existing registration information on file at the Website. We do this to improve 
                    personalization of our services (for example, providing better newsletter content, advertising 
                    and/or special offers that we think may be of interest you).</p>
                    
                    <p>We may also collect other information such as your IP address, domain names, access times and 
                    referring third party website addresses. This information is used by 
                    <a href="http://www.SilveriNet.com/">SilveriNet.com</a> for the operation of the Website, to maintain the quality of our 
                    offerings, and to provide general aggregate statistics regarding .com.  Such 
                    information is not personally identifiable. </p>
                    
                    <p>We also collect information such as the identification of the server that your computer is logged 
                    onto and whether you opened a .com e-mail message delivered to you.  We also 
                    may compare our member list to various lists received from other third party companies, in an 
                    effort to avoid sending identical or similar e-mail messages to our members.</p>
                    
                    <p>When you obtain any product or service directly from <a href="http://www.SilveriNet.com/">SilveriNet.com</a>, we 
                    collect certain financial information, such as your credit card number, credit card expiration date 
                    and billing address.  Financial Information that you disclose to <a href="http://www.SilveriNet.com/">SilveriNet.com</a> 
                    
                    is used to confirm your age and to bill you for shipping our products and services.  To the extent 
                    that customer credit card-specific information is collected by <a href="http://www.SilveriNet.com/">SilveriNet.com</a>, 
                    said information will be kept in confidence and will not be shared with any third parties (other 
                    than consumer credit agencies) without your prior informed consent.  Notwithstanding the 
                    foregoing, <a href="http://www.SilveriNet.com/">SilveriNet.com</a> reserves the right to share with third parties the fact 
                    that we have credit card information on file for specific customers but we will not share the 
                    specific credit card information with third parties without your prior informed consent.  </p>
                    
                    <h4>Information Collection Processes</h4>
                    <p><a href="http://www.SilveriNet.com/">SilveriNet.com</a> may employ "cookies" to help customize your access to the 
                    Website and for the delivery of targeted advertisements.  A cookie is a piece of data stored on a 
                    your hard drive containing information about you.  Cookies have many benefits to enhance your 
                    experience at our Website and to facilitate the receipt of targeted advertisements.  For instance, 
                    by setting a cookie on our Website, a member would not have to log in a password more than 
                    once, thereby saving time while on our Website.  Even in the case where a member rejects a 
                    cookie, they may still use our Website.  The only drawback to this is that the member will be 
                    limited in what he/she can access in some areas on our Website, much like visitor-level access. </p>
                    
                    <p>We occasionally use cookies to anonymously track and target the interests of our members to 
                    further enhance the experience on our Website and for advertising, tracking and/or delivery 
                    purposes.   To find out more about cookies, please visit www.cookiecentral.com.  To disable and 
                    reject cookies, click here.  At no time will we share cookie-related and/or data with third parties.</p>
                    
                    <p>In addition to cookies, our Website pages and/or e-mails may contain electronic images known 
                    as "pixel tags" (also knows as clear gifs) to track the pages that visitors and/or members visit at 
                    the Website for purposes of formatting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used 
                    in reporting statistics.  </p>
                    
                    <p>Our Website may also contain pixel tags placed there by third parties to help determine the 
                    effectiveness of a joint promotional or advertising campaign. </p>
                    
                    <h4>Security </h4>
